## Goal?

Improve [http://demo.united.vote/](http://demo.united.vote/).

What's [http://demo.united.vote/](http://demo.united.vote/)?

It's participatory democracy with delegation. If legislation affects you, you can vote on it. If you trust someone elses vote, you can delegate your vote to them. When they vote, you vote along with them.

## Scope: What needs to be done?

There exists a legacy code base react client for rendering legislation and letting users vote on it. I work with engineers in Berkeley, Brooklyn and Oakland. And I have friends and family in Madison, Boulder, Santa Cruz and Sebastopol. And I live in San Francisco. I want to have a live United.Vote for friends and family to test in all of these places.

The specc: a user should be able to see items on upcoming city council agendas
