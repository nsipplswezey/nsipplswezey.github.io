title: The Value in the Ritual of Algorithms

## A New Series: The Ritual of Algorithms

The VoltAGE blogging/dev journaling has taught me that getting good at writing clearly about what I'm working on is a big personal value add.

In organizing the work in some form that might make sense to an outside reader, I find my communication and understanding gets better. Writing clearly builds my reflexes for reducing complexity, focusing specifically, and verifying understanding. Additionally it can take a good day of coding that doesn't result in a commit, and turn it into tangible output. It amounts to a sort of daily micro-sprint reflection. It also serves as a back reference. After taking time off to work on other things, having a clear reference and linnear narrative can get me back into building. And I can look at my work from a third person perspective, and understand where I might improve, or where my surprises, bottle-necks or misunderstandings are. 

Additionally, I've learned that developing a consistent narrative structure that fits technical writing is really useful. In VoltAGE that's been "Goal", "Scope: What needs to be done?", and "Up and Running". Essentially this is motivation, action, and proof of result.

This series is going to explore applying that narrative structure to understanding, exploring and deepening my practical experiences with the ritual of building and rebuilding data structures and algorithms. I'll take the same approach of building quickly while reflecting and improving iteratively.

## An Exploratory Motivation

Building and rebuilding datastructures and algorithms seems to me to be a cultural ritual of software engineering. This is a first draft, and we'll see how well this holds.

Immediate responses might be: "Algorithms and data structures aren't a cultural 'ritual'. They're just proof that you know what you're doing. That you understand the fundamentals. They're proof that you aren't an imposter." That's imagined. There might be other responses as well.

I personally believe there are really good reason to push back on ritualizing technology, as I'm doing here. I use the word ritual somewhat begrudgingly. It's a powerful word with deep contextual roots. Like any powerful context dependent word, it benefits from consistent clarification. 

The sense of ritual I'm intending to use is something like the dictionary definition of "a solemn ceremony consisting of a series of actions performed according to a prescribed order." That word "solemn" is interesting to me, because it's not my own. Nor is it a word I –or anyone I know– actually uses to communicate. The sense of "solemn" that I'm intending is "characterized by dignified or serious formality, as proceedings; of a formal or ceremonious character." I suppose the idea is to approach the ritual of working through common problems of data structure and algorithm with dignity, instead of say, derision. 

## Goal?

Explore applying a technical blogging template to understanding, exploring and deepening my practical experiences with the ritual of building and rebuilding datastructures and algorithms. Build quickly while reflecting and improving iteratively.

The technical problem: find cycles in a linked list

```
Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

Try solving it using constant additional space.
```

```
Input : 

                  ______
                 |     |
                 \/    |
        1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4

Return the node corresponding to node 3. 
```

## Scope: What needs to be done?

Let's dig in. The first step in the algorithms and data structures ritual I'm observing is that the constraints of the problem are important, and often not obvious. The constraints need to be discovered, interpretated, organized and maintained. In a word, they need to be honored.

Let's discover some constraints.

How do I go about discovering constraints? A combination of "try something" and "ask questions". And I guess 3rd, "relax, don't freak out and perserve."

Try something: I could build a quick linked list in JS using functional instantiation patterns. Then write a function that recurisvely searches the list, storing known values in a hashmap(dictionary), and checking if a known value re-occurs.

Ask questions: Do I get to build my own linked list? No. It turns out the environment we're working in provides us a pre-build linked list to traverse.

Oh. Ok. I wonder in what language is used to implement the linked list? I'll have to use the same to treverse it.

Ask questions: What languages can you use? C, C++, Java, Python.

Oh...

I'm going to have to refresh all my C, C++, Java or Python on the fly –which means I'm going to make lots of mistakes– and this is going to take me forever and now I'm embarassed.

Relax, don't freak out and perserve.

Of those 4, I'll take python. Even though I've been writing Android Java for the last 2 weeks, and have been reading and writing a little C++, python is higher level language, seems less verbose, and might be more familiar to my default world of web and mobile application engineering.

Ask questions: Ok. Given that the list is already provided, and languages pre-determined what else is provided?

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    # @param A : head node of linked list
    # @return the first node in the cycle in the linked list
    def detectCycle(self, A):
    
```        

Ok. Cool. So let's see...

The variable `A` in our `detectCycle` definition seems like a node in our list.

And then our constructor suggests that `A.val` should be the nodes value, and `A.next` should be the next node.

Alright. This seems like enough to get started. Let's give this a shot.

Try something: Here's a reasonable approach. Keep track of all values that have occured so far in a dictionary `prev` that's in the enclosing scope. Check the next value against that dictionary result.

```
prev = {}

class Solution:
    # @param A : head node of linked list
    # @return the first node in the cycle in the linked list
    def detectCycle(self, A):
        
        # if the next is any of the previous then we have a cycle
        if A.next in prev:
            return A

        # if A.next is None, return none
        if A.next == None:
            return None
        
        prev[A.val] = True
        
        return Solution.detectCycle(self, A.next)
```

This blows up with `RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded`

```

Along with more more detail...

```
There are 2 lines in the input

Line 1 ( Corresponds to arg 1 ) : Elements in the linked list. First number S is the number of nodes. Then S numbers follow indicating the val in each of the nodes in sequence
	For example, LinkedList: "5 --> 9 --> 7" will be written as "3 5 9 7"(without quotes).

Line 2 : Integer X corresponding to a node position. If the integer is -1, then there is no loop. Otherwise, the end node has a next edge to node number X.
	For example, Integer: "-1" will be written as "-1"(without quotes).
The expected output for this testcase is:
98928
```

Immediate rection: I must have written my recursion wrong. This should work. Oh. What's this new information?

`LinkedList: "5 --> 9 --> 7" will be written as "3 5 9 7"(without quotes).`

Ok. So there's more information now. I know the length of the input linked list. 

Now I'm wondering... how can I test whether my recursion is messed up. Maybe the provided linked list is too big? Before trying something, I didn't even think about that possibility. It looks like the linked list its running on has 746 elements. It seems like python should be able to support recursive functional calls at least 746 deep.

Let's try and reduce the complexity to something simpler and more tractable.

Question: Can I run on simpler input? Yes.

So I try `3 5 9 7` and get `RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded`. Clearly there's something wrong with my approach.

At this point I would want to do some logging...

Try something: Add a `print()` statement.

```

        # if A.next is None, return none
        if A.next == None:
            return None
        
        prev[A.val] = True
        
        print(A.val)
        
        return Solution.detectCycle(self, A.next)
```


```
Your input:
3 5 9 7

There are 2 lines in the input

`RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded`

Definitely something wrong with my recursion. What could it be?

`A.next` is a node, not a value. So to check whether the value exists in our hashmap, we need to change:

```
        # if the next is any of the previous then we have a cycle
        if A.next in prev:
            return A
```            

to

```
        # if the next is any of the previous then we have a cycle
        if A.val in prev:
            return A
```            

Then here's where it gets tough. 

As much as I try, a recursive solution seems to consistently throw errors. Even when I log the result and get the expected output, something doesn't work in the tests. Maybe it's an oversight on my part. That would seem natural, given that the whole endevour has just been making progress through oversights. Or it could be a quirk in how the test is implemented. Who knows.

So what then? 

Try something: refactor into iteration. Use a `while` loop instead of recursive approaches, and move on!

### Up and Running

```
class Solution:
    # @param A : head node of linked list
    # @return the first node in the cycle in the linked list
    def detectCycle(self, A):
        
        prev = set()
        while A:
            if A.val in prev:
                return A
            else:
                prev.add(A.val)
                A = A.next
```

Also, use a set instead of a dictionary, which we can now define in-scope of our method. Everything else is just about the same.

A few insights. This foray into the cultural ritual of algorithms and data structure problems is less about knowing your data structures and algorithms, and more about executing a solution search process.

In this case, what I notice most clearly in my search, is the discovery of the ambiguity of the constraints.

"How is the link list constructed?" is a great question. We don't really get to see, but we have enough information to infer.

And it turns out "does our environment support recursion?" is another good question. Recursion –a standard approach to traversal of a data structure– just plain wouldn't work(at least it seems that way).

Furthermore, the answer someone gives you to the question, might not be consistent or legitimate. Nowhere is it explicit that recursion might fail tests, even though it seems to work. That's ok. That's part of the ritual.

That highlights the depth to which you might question your assumptions.

Another insight is that it may be worthwhile to just start iteratively, and only refactor into a recursive approach if necessary, or if asked. 

It also turns out that recursion without memoization is expensive in python. I think I knew this, but it's always a nice reminder.

## Insights

Ask questions. Reasoning through constraints is always part of the problem.

Try something. When you've updated your mental model, give it another try.

Don't freak out. Relax and perserve. You're going to make mistakes in your first implementation. Keep going.

## Other Notes For Reference

Multiple assignment

```
a = b = c
```

This is just a way to declare a and b as equal to c.

Check for values in dictionary or set.

```
if val in dict:
```
