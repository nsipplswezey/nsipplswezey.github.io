## Goal?

Build [united.vote/nyc]("https://united.vote/nyc").

What's [united.vote]("https://united.vote/")?

See [united.vote/sf]("https://united.vote/sf").

Oh [united.vote/sf]("https://united.vote/sf") is broken? They're rebuilding the new version of liquid.vote? 

And it's ![under construction](https://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/26327/1444070256569233.gif)

## Day 5

Someday, day 5 will actually be Day 5. By that I mean, things take longer than you'd expect. Life pops up. The weekend comes. Starting is easy, making progress is fun, finishing is hard.

The goal of cleaning up a pull request is for the pull request to clearly solve one issue, while causing as few new other issues as possible. In essence, change the existing codebase as little as possible.

Your PR should be experienced as something like "in as few lines, of clearly readable and understandable code, that doesn't affect any other functionality of the app, I offer a solution to problem X. What do you think?" And Eric's PR is just about there.

## Changes
A lot of good things
- it's `https://united.vote` now
- purescript API has been updated, and responds with more bills per request
- schema for the API backing `united.vote/nyc` has been updated with `uid`
- `SYNC_BILLS` reducer has been fixed correctly update the `/sf` bills state
- pathing between `/sf` and `/nyc` has been narrowed down to `NextAgendaScreen`

## Next Steps
Let's make ourselves some more problems. How do we gracefully handle more local legislature APIs?
