## The Ritual of Algorithms: Reference Sheet

This is the collection of practices in python I've seen for solving algorithms problems.

Reduce a list to a dictionary for quicker search
```
for a in A: #[1,5,3,5]
    if a in hashDict:
        hashDict[a] += 1

    else:
        hashDict[a] = 1
        #{1:1, 5:2, 3:1}
```

Copy an array
```
copy = A[:]
```

Reverse a list
```
reversed(list)
```

Iterate
```
for index, bulb in enumerate(arr):
```

Iterate
```
for i in range(n): #[0,1,2] i=0, i=1, i=2
        x = A[i] #element
```

Iterating and comparing prior to next
```
curr = (X[0], Y[0]) #i=0 initial
        for i in range(1,n):
            #curr[0] is where i = 0 and X[i] = 1
            stepsX = abs(curr[0] - X[i]) i= 22
            stepsY = abs(curr[1] - Y[i])
            ret += max(stepsX, stepsY)
            curr = (X[i], Y[i]) #i = 1
```
