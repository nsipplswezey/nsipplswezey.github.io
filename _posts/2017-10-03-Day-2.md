## Goal?

Build [liquid.vote/berkeley]("https://liquid.vote/berkeley").

What's [liquid.vote]("https://liquid.vote/")?

See [liquid.vote/sf]("https://liquid.vote/sf").

Oh [liquid.vote/sf]("https://liquid.vote/sf") is broken? They're rebuilding the new version of liquid.vote? 

And it's ![under construction](https://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/26327/1444070256569233.gif)


## Dev and Prod

I have git access to some version of the source for this `api.liquid.vote` server. It's backed by RethinkDB. I'd have to ask David for the keys. Or I'd have to generate my own. Redploy it.

I also have access to the backing legislative data for San Francisco. So I know the schema of the input data. David's backend handles the other things like users, votes and delegation. Mostly I care about handling the legislative data. That's the right place to start.

Both production API endpoints are broken.

```

```

So let's get a handle on endpoints. What does the client request? What fails? What does it intend to render?
