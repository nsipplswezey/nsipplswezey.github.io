## The Ritual of Algorithms

The ritual of algorithms is now about speed. How do you work faster? Work simpler. It turns out that a live code execution environment slows things down dramaticaly. Surprising right? Surprised me too. Why does live execution go slower? 

Holding the problem in your brain allows you to simplify and alter course as needed, though often with a bit more cognitive load. 

Holding the problem in a code execution environment pins you to the complexities of the environment. You can't assume a helper exists; you have to implement it. You can't make a mistake and say "oh well I knew what I meant" instead you have to debug the mistake, before you're actually done with a reasonable approach.

Previously I'd always thought that seeing the actual execution state of your application in real time would help. But in fact it bogs you down. It's faster to see the expected state in your head.

So the ritual of algorithms occurs in a non-execution environment format. And with time constraints.

Which means we're updating the forward format of these posts! We'll start with the problem. Then we'll follow with whatever solution is hatched up in 30 minutes, in a non-execution envrionment. The goal is to write functional code by the end of the 30 minutes, without ever actually running a line of it. After that 30 minutes window, we follow up by running the code, observing oversights, making changes to get to a running state, looking for optimizations, and noticing insights. 

Let's get to it.

## Goal?

```
# For Given Number N find if its COLORFUL number or not

# Return 0/1

# COLORFUL number:

# A number can be broken into different contiguous sub-subsequence parts. 
# Suppose, a number 3245 can be broken into parts like 3 2 4 5 32 24 45 324 245. 
# And this number is a COLORFUL number, since product of every digit of a contiguous subsequence is different
# Example:

# N = 23
# 2 3 23
# 2 -> 2
# 3 -> 3
# 23 -> 6
# this number is a COLORFUL number since product of every digit of a sub-sequence are different. 

# Output : 1


#whats the condition of COLORFUL
#one number => parts, parts are contig
#3245 => [3 2 4 5 32 24 45 324 245]

#product of a contig sub is different
#hash map check

# N = 23 => [2, 3, 23] => [2,3, (2*3)] => are all elements unique



# return is True or False


23 => {2: 0, 3:0, 23:0}

{2: 0, 3:0, 6:0}


#reduce in python => findProd
#enumarate start integer
#spliting a string
#all possible combinations
# replace concat string[i:j + 1]
#time complexity

def color(num):
    
    #3245 => [3, 2, 4, 5] => [32,24,45] => [324,245]
    splitNum = num.toString().split() # [3,2,4,5]
    partialResult = {}
    inputLength = len(splitNum) # 4
    for ele, i in enumerate(splitNum):
        num = ele #num = 3
        inc = 0
        while(i+inc <= inputLength): #(2 + 1) <= 4
            
            #num = 32
            product = num.reduce((memo, curr) => {return memo*curr})
            #product = 6
            
            if(product in hash):
                return False
            
            partialResult[num] = num #{3:3,6:6}
            
            inc += 1 # 2
            if (i + inc < inputLength): #2 + 2 < 4
                num = num.concat(splitNum[i + inc]) # 3 splitNum[1+1]
            #num = 32
            
        
        string[i:j + 1]
        
        
    [2,23,3]
    
    [2,6,3]
    
    {2,6,3}

document.querySelectorAll(".fade").forEach( (ele) => { ele.remove()})

def findProd(A):
    ret = 1
    for a in A:
        ret *= int(a)
    return str(ret)

class Solution:
    # @param A : integer
    # @return an integer
    def colorful(self, A):
        numbers = dict()
        strA = str(A)
        for a in strA:
            if a in numbers:
                return 0
            else:
                numbers[a] = 1
                
        n = len(strA) #4
        
        #3245
        
        for i in range(2, n+1): #[2,3,4,5]
            for j in range(n-i+1): #[4-2+1] => [1,2,3]
                num = strA[j:j+i] #strA[2,5] => '245'
                ret = findProd(num) #reducer
                if ret in numbers:
                    return 0 #check
                else:
                    numbers[ret] = 1 #{prod1:1}
        return 1
