## The Ritual of Algorithms

The ritual of algorithms is now about speed. How do you work faster? Work simpler. It turns out that a live code execution environment slows things down dramaticaly. Surprising right? Surprised me too. Why does live execution go slower? 

Holding the problem in your brain allows you to simplify and alter course as needed, though often with a bit more cognitive load. 

Holding the problem in a code execution environment pins you to the complexities of the environment. You can't assume a helper exists; you have to implement it. You can't make a mistake and say "oh well I knew what I meant" instead you have to debug the mistake, before you're actually done with a reasonable approach.

Previously I'd always thought that seeing the actual execution state of your application in real time would help. But in fact it bogs you down. It's faster to see the expected state in your head.

So the ritual of algorithms occurs in a non-execution environment format. And with time constraints.

Which means we're updating the forward format of these posts! We'll start with the problem. Then we'll follow with whatever solution is hatched up in 30 minutes, in a non-execution envrionment. The goal is to write functional code by the end of the 30 minutes, without ever actually running a line of it. After that 30 minutes window, we follow up by running the code, observing oversights, making changes to get to a running state, looking for optimizations, and noticing insights. 

Let's get to it.

## Goal?

```
    
# You are in an infinite 2D grid where you can move in any of the 8 directions :

#  (x,y) to 
#     (x+1, y), 
#     (x - 1, y), 
#     (x, y+1), 
#     (x, y-1), 
#     (x-1, y-1), 
#     (x+1,y+1), 
#     (x-1,y+1), 
#     (x+1,y-1) 
# You are given a sequence of points and the order in which you need to cover the points. Give the minimum number of steps in which you can achieve it. You start from the first point.

# Example :

# Input : [(0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)]
# Output : 2
# It takes 1 step to move from (0, 0) to (1, 1). It takes one more step to move from (1, 1) to (1, 2).

# This question is intentionally left slightly vague. Clarify the question by trying out a few cases in the “See Expected Output” section.


#move to each point
#generate all possible moves from that point to the next point
#add those points to a queue
#do that for every point until you've arrived at your destination
#do that for every destination until you're done with destinations

#multiple destinations
#we're done when the destination queue is empty
#return the sum of total moves necessary

#helpers:
#8 direction move helper => [[x+1, y, moves+1],[x - 1, y, moves+1],[x, y+1],[x, y-1],[x-1, y-1],[x+1,y+1],[x-1,y+1],[x+1,y-1]]
#check if our current coordinates are destination coordinates

#assumptions:
#input is a list [[0,0],[1,1],[1,2]] which we can treat as a queue

def paths(destinations): #destinations is a list
    
    origin = destintations.pop(0) # [0,0]
    origin[2] = 0 # [0,0,0]
    destination = destinations.pop(0) # [1,1]
    destination[2] = 0 #[1,1,0]
    current = origin #[0,0,0]
    futureLocations = []
    
    while(destination is not None): #[1,1,0]
        
        if(current[0] == destination[0] and current[1] == destination[1]):
            #1 == 0 and 
            destination = destinations.pop(0)
        
        if(destination == None): #[1,1,0]
            return current[2]
        
        addsNextPossibleMoves(current,futureLocations) #including inc moves
        #[[], ... []]
        
        current = futureLocations.pop(0) #[1,0,1]
        
        
```

Not a bad start. When we get to execution we find important oversights.

1. Popping off an empty array throws an error. A better way to tell when we're finished is to check the destinations queue length.

1. It helps to use a simple flag as in `while (not done):` pattern rather than `while(destination is not None):`. The `done` flag is a good separation of concerns.

1. It helps to hold a result variable, and assign it when needed, and return it; clearer naming and separation of concerns.

1. When calculating the minimum number of jumps, it seems intuitive to me to hold that data with the potential future coordinates. Essentially every move knows how many jumps it's been to get there, rather than calculating that value locally.

1. It turns out we have to wipe our potential moves array whenever we get to our next destination! Duh!

    [x, y+1, moves+1],
    [x, y-1, moves+1],

    [x+1,y+1, moves+1],

    futureLocations.append(ele) #this should operate by side effect
    #futureLocations = futureLocations

# testFutureLocations = []
# addsNextPossibleMoves([0,0,0],testFutureLocations)
# print(testFutureLocations)
# print(len(testFutureLocations))

print(paths([[0,0],[1,1],[2,2],[0,0],[2,2],[5,5],[0,0]]))


# paths([[0,0],[1,1],[1,2]])
  
  
  #things I'm learning
  #I'm gettin faster. I made it further into a solution in 30 mins
  #In python:
  #Popping from empty list throws erros
  #Assigning to out of bounds index throws errors
  #Check queue lengths, instead of Popping
  #Add values to lists using append
  
```

## Insights

The significant insight from this exercise is:

Write code in a non-execution environment. Reason through it mentally.

Time constraints will focus your work. Get done what you can in 30 minutes, and you'll get more done than you might if you give yourself an hour.

Past insights:

Ask questions. Reasoning through constraints is always part of the problem.

Try something. When you've updated your mental model, give it another try.

Don't freak out. Relax and persevere. You're going to make mistakes in your first implementation. Keep going.

Write bugs. Fix them thoughtfully.

## Optimized Solution

I'll dig into an optimized solution later.
