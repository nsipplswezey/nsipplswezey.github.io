## The Ritual of Algorithms

The ritual of algorithms is now about speed. How do you work faster? Work simpler. It turns out that a live code execution environment slows things down dramaticaly. Surprising right? Surprised me too. Why does live execution go slower? 

Holding the problem in your brain allows you to simplify and alter course as needed, though often with a bit more cognitive load. 

Holding the problem in a code execution environment pins you to the complexities of the environment. You can't assume a helper exists; you have to implement it. You can't make a mistake and say "oh well I knew what I meant" instead you have to debug the mistake, before you're actually done with a reasonable approach.

Previously I'd always thought that seeing the actual execution state of your application in real time would help. But in fact it bogs you down. It's faster to see the expected state in your head.

So the ritual of algorithms occurs in a non-execution environment format. And with time constraints.

Which means we're updating the forward format of these posts! We'll start with the problem. Then we'll follow with whatever solution is hatched up in 30 minutes, in a non-execution envrionment. The goal is to write functional code by the end of the 30 minutes, without ever actually running a line of it. After that 30 minutes window, we follow up by running the code, observing oversights, making changes to get to a running state, looking for optimizations, and noticing insights. 

Let's get to it.

## Goal?

```
# // # 
# // # POWER2
# // # Given a positive integer which fits in a 32 bit signed integer, find if it can be expressed as A^P where P > 1 and A > 0. A and P both should be integers.
# // # 
# // # Example:
# // # Input : 4
# // # Output : True  
# // # as 2^2 = 4.
# // # 
# // #  
# 
# 
# // [00000000000000000000000]
# // [000 ... 000] 32 bits
# 
# // [000 ... 000] 32 bits
# 
# // [000 ... 000] 32 bits
# 
# // 1000 0000 0000 0001 1 
# // 1000 0000 0000 0010 2
# // 1000 0000 0000 0011 3
# // 1000 0000 0000 0100 4
# // 1000 0000 0000 0101 5
# // 1000 0000 0000 0111 6
# // 1000 0000 0000 0110 7
# // 1000 0000 0000 0100 8
# // 0000 0000 0000 0100 -8
# // 0000 0000 0000 0110 -7
# 
# 
# // Math.pow(n,m)
# 
# // 2^31 = 2,147,483,648
# 
# // let input4 = 31
# 
# // function findIfFits(N) {
#   
# //   for (let a = 1; a < N; a++) {    
# //     for (let p = 2; p < Math.sqrt(N); p++) {   
# //       if (Math.pow(a, p) === N) {
# //         return true
# //       }
# //     }
# //   }
# //   return false
# 
# // }
# 
def root(n,m):
    #take the root
    return n**(1/float(m))


def checkInt(val):
    rounded = round(val)
    return abs(rounded - val) <= 0.0000001
    
def power2(integer):
    
    #how can we reduce work
    
    if(integer > 2**31):
        #throw an error
        return False
        
    for i in range(integer): #[1 ... 2^31]
        exp = i + 1
        resultRoot = root(integer,exp)
        print(exp,integer,resultRoot)
        if (exp > 1 and (checkInt(resultRoot) )): #root(100,2) == 10
            return True
    
    return False


print(power2(8))
print(power2(27))
print(power2(7*7*7))
print(power2(7*7*7*7*7))
```
